# crackmeifyoucan

Resources, utils, writeups, etc. related to my activity in
previous CMIYC contests.

CMIYC is "The premier annual password cracking contest sponsored by KoreLogic.".
It occurs every year during DefCon. This repository serves as the location for
writeups, thoughts, scores, approaches, and anything else related to a given
year's contents for our team, **ThatOnePasswordWas40Passwords**.

If you have any questions, problems, concerns, or otherwise, drop an issue and
we'll take a look.

Thanks!

## Info

This repository contains a year-named set of folders for writeups/resources/etc
that reflect the experience of the competition for that respective year's 48 hour
contest, only.

To see a more thorough examaniation of a given year's hashes some time
**after** the competition, visit [historical_analysis](./historical_analysis).
That folder will serve as a place to continually iterate on a prior
competition's challenges, ultimately trying to 100% any given hash
with all prior knowledge taken into consideration.
