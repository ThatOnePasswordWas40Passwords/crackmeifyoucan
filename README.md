# crackmeifyoucan

Resources, utils, writeups, etc. related to my activity in
previous CMIYC contests.

CMIYC is "The premier annual password cracking contest sponsored by KoreLogic.".
It occurs every year during DefCon. This repository serves as the location for
writeups, thoughts, scores, approaches, and anything else related to a given
year's contents for our team, **ThatOnePasswordWas40Passwords**.

If you have any questions, problems, concerns, or otherwise, drop an issue and
we'll take a look.

Thanks!
