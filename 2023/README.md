## [Results](https://contest-2023.korelogic.com/stats.html)

We placed 5th overall for street this year, a new best!

## Takeaways, notes, errata, etc.

- We really need to work on some scoring tooling. Manually submitting and trying
  to track the diff/status of now 3 people working on the team (compared to
  just 1) is a massive PITA.

- Time to make a Google Languages API account
  - Need to find some way to reliable translate things, or just start looking
    for good resources for popular things in other languages

- Priortizing fewer, higher point solves is signififcantly more effective in
  getting score points than trying to 100% raw MD5... solely for bragging
  rights.
